doi.org | <s> The analysis of the data generated by the mobile phone or GPS shows that human movement in the urban scale (e.g., inside a city) generally has an exponential or binomial trip-length distribution [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . Although this does not simply mean that short-range human mobility is random, the related dynamical feature is similar with that of the Boltzmann gas, if the relevance among individuals is so weak as to be negligible [76, 80, 81] . Accordingly, the homogeneous mixing (within each subpopulation) assumption is adopted to ease the

Recent empirical findings on human mobility have shown the crucial role of commuting mobility in human daily transportation, which is reflected by the individual recurrent movement between frequently visited locations such as household, school, and workplace [92] [93] [94] [95] . Fig. 3b visualizes the US commuting network with the census data on commuting trips between counties [96] . Evidently, the structural features are different between the commuting network and the air transportation network. </s>

doi.org | <s> It is now recognized that the hallmark persistent wheeze of asthma is consolidated in childhood and, further, may progress to chronic asthma in adulthood (3, 4) and potentially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5, 6) . We and others have previously shown that development of persistent atopic (allergic) wheeze in children is linked to the number of virusassociated febrile and/or wheezy LRI experienced during infancy (7) (8) (9) (10) . The principal virus type of current interest is human rhinoviruses (HRV), particularly subtype C (HRV-C) (11) , however respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is also recognized as a major cause of infant LRI (12) .

doi.org | <s> Early protein comparisons showed that related proteins often differ by transitions more than expected by chance (e.g., Fitch 1967; sources cited in Vogel 1972) . By the 1980's, this "transition bias" was well known (Li, et al. 1985) .

Grantham does not directly address this issue, but a genetic-code-based calculation shows that the mean Grantham distance for transition-mediated replacements is lower than that for transversions, e.g., as indicated in Table 2 of Xia, et al (1998) . The study by Vogel and Kopun is often cited as evidence for the conservative transitions hypothesis, because they present a calculation that, for 3 different biochemical measures, suggests that transitions are more conservative. </s>
