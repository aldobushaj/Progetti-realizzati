BTV infects mammalian cells, usually resulting in a lytic infection, while infection of KC cells derived from the BTV vector Culicoides sonorensis, become persistently infected with little or no evidence of cell lysis [56] , [57] . Previous work showed that intracellular expression of an NS1 specific antibody fragment (scFv) destabilised the formation of NS1 tubules in BTV infected cells [14] . As a consequence, cells became persistently infected and viruses exited by budding instead of via cell lysis.

The 1918 pandemic H1N1 and high pathogenic H5N1 viruses preferentially infect type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophage in mice [15] , [30] . Alveolar macrophages may play a critical role in disease pathogenesis, not through production of infectious virus but rather through the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines that may further damage alveolar pneumocytes [31] . These phenomena suggest that viral cell tropism may determine the processes of ARDS.

 Many studies have shown that Cryptosporidium can infect humans and more than 170 kinds of animals, and mammalian Cryptosporidium infection plays an important role in the transmission of human cryptosporidiosis (Zhang and Jiang, 2001; Zhang et al., 2013b) . Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are two of the most common species infecting humans (Molloy et al., 2010) . After entering the human body and animal body via fecaleoral route, they mainly parasitize on the intestinal epithelial cells as well as organs (including stomach, respiratory tract, lung, liver, tonsil, pancreas, gallbladder, and others) (Ortega and Sanchez, 2010; Ryan et al., 2014; Xiao and Feng, 2008) . Moreover, Cryptosporidium is seriously harmful to the safety of drinking water. 
 It also appears that expression of a specific target cell receptor, the total number of receptors expressed on the cell, and the use of soluble cofactors play roles in determining which target cells are infected by FeLVs . 
 They are almost identical to those seen in horses with C. perfringens type C infection and consist mainly of multifocal to diffuse, often hemorrhagic, coagulative isolated from cattle with enteritis but also infected by other pathogens , and although it is very likely that this microorganism plays a role in enteritis of cattle, final evidence to support this assertion is lacking. 
 disease subsequently occurred in two close contacts in Great Britain with no history of travel, as well as an instance of nosocomial transmission in France where the index case was exposed in the Middle East, provide evidence the virus can be spread person to person. 99 In addition to the 2012 Jordanian hospital cluster, another outbreak in April 2013 involving 22 persons, including health care workers, and 9 deaths in an eastern Saudi Arabian hospital suggests nosocomial transmission. 100 Genetic analyses of this novel coronavirus show it is the first lineage C betacoronavirus infecting humans and has a close relationship to betacoronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 found in bats, including insectivorous bat species present in the Middle East. 101-103 A virus with 100% sequence homology to the MERS-CoV isolated from the 2012 Saudi Arabian index case was found in an Egyptian tomb bat (Tapho zous perforatus) trapped in the vicinity of that patient's home. 104 These findings suggest bats play an important role in the ecology of MERS-CoV and could be the reservoir for this new coronavirus. 
 influenza pandemics, pathological evaluation of respiratory tract tissues from influenza-associated deaths suggested that marked differences exist in viral tropism and tissue damage compared with seasonal influenza virus infections. 4e8 Studies of previous pandemic deaths concluded that most (96%) of these deaths were likely due to viral infection, concurrent with secondary bacterial pneumonia. 6, 9, 10 A significant proportion of 2009 pH1N1infected fatal cases showed severe pneumonia. 11 Histopathological studies of 2009 pH1N1 virus infection showed that extensive diffuse alveolar damage is the most consistent finding, and the virus predominantly infected the lung parenchyma. 3, 12 In addition, fatal cases are mainly young to middle-aged patients, 13 and 40% to 60% of fatal cases have an underlying medical condition. 13e16 Previous studies suggested that inadvertent host immunological responses play an important role in the pathogenesis of H5N1 17,18 and SARS-CoV 19 infections. 
 CD4+ T cells infected by HIV-1 display a cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase, which eventually leads to cell death. 1, 2 This is thought to contribute to the loss of CD4+ T cells and to the development of immunodeficiency. 3, 4 A virally encoded accessory protein, Vpr, is a major player in the induction of G2 arrest and apoptosis in CD4+ T cells. 
 (HIV) (Mollace et al., 2001) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) (He et al., 2012a) . TGEV induces a CPE in ST cells, and this effect is associated with TGEV-induced apoptosis (Eleouet et al., 1998) . Furthermore, the ROS response is up regulated in TGEV-infected cells, and ROS accumulation causes oxidative stress, which plays an important role in the TGEV-induced apoptosis pathway (Ding et al., 2013) . Antiviral studies have shown that EGCG decreases the ROS levels in MDCK cells infected by influenza A virus and inhibits influenza A replication (Ling et al., 2012) . In addition, the replication of enterovirus 71 is inhibited by EGCG, which is consistent with the down regulation of ROS generation in infected Vero cells (Ho et al., 2009) . As a natural antioxidant, (+)-catechin can protect human hepatoma cells (HepG2) from oxidative DNA damage induced by heterocyclic amines (Haza and Morales, 2011) . Additionally, the apoptosis 
 TGEV infected ST cells showed significant levels of caspase-3 activation from 14 to 18 h post infection (h.p.i.), as revealed by the cleavage of procaspase-3 to an active caspase-3 (35-kDa to 17-and 19-kDa polypeptides) (Yang et al., 2007) . Moreover, TGEV infects ST cells, which subsequently show cytopathic effects such as a rounding and enlargement of cells, formation of syncytia, and detachment of cells into the medium (Yang et al., 2007) . At a concentration of 1 μM, ouabain, oleandrin, digitoxin, reevesioside A, reevesioside F, epi-reevesioside F, all exerted strong protection against caspase-3 activation; while the less potent dehydroouabain and reevesioside G/epi-reevesioside G did not ( Fig. 2A) .

 Our data demonstrate that DCs from hAPNtransgenic mice are infected by HCoV-229E in a receptordependent fashion, and Thiel et al. have shown that HCoV-229E virus-like particles transduce human DCs (Thiel et al., 2003) . Therefore, DCs in the human respiratory epithelium may play a role in the initiation of HCoV-229E infection and its dissemination to other tissues. 
 The M1 coat protein (CP) plays a dominant role in controlling CymMV movement between cells, because all chimeric CymMV viruses containing the M1 CP systemically infected N. benthamiana plants. 
 As the smallest DNA virus infecting mammals, PCV2 replication depends on cellular enzymes expressed during the S phase of cells growth (Tischer et al., 1987) . Experimental evidence shows that the UPS plays an important role in the regulation of the cell cycle, including the induction of S, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis (Han et al., 2009) . To investigate whether the downregulation of the PCV2 titer is due to the effect of proteasome inhibitors on cell cycle progression, a flow cytometric analysis was performed based on the DNA content observed in nuclei stained

Dysregulated type I IFN and inflammatory monocyte-MØ responses in SARS-CoV-infected mice resulted in high levels of cytokines and chemokines and impaired virusspecific T-cell responses leading to lethal pneumonia . Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infect human primary T cells and induce massive apoptosis and lymphopenia, although they do not produce infectious virus in these cells (Chu et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2015) . Infection of T cells may play a role in controlling the pathogenesis elicited by both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV . 
 Infection with T. annulata in vivo, induces suppressor or regulatory M which are capable of inhibiting both the proliferation of T. annulata infected cells (Preston and Brown, 1988) as well as the polyclonally activated T cells which are induced by infected cells (Preston et al., 2002) . It is not clear what the mechanisms for such inhibition are, although at least a component appears to involve indomethicin sensitive prostaglandin (Preston et al., 2002) . Nor is it clear if these ill-defined M populations play protective or pathogenic roles during infection with T. annulata parasite. 
 The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to identify group differences and the differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. macrophages can play a role in clearing H4N6 LPAIV infected cells as has been shown in mouse model of influenza infection (Hashimoto et al., 2007) . However, the lack of significant differences in H4N6 LPAIV genome loads between clodronate liposome treated and controls could be two-fold. 
 The genomic revolution is transforming paradigms of hostagent interaction from simple models of mutual antagonism towards ecosystem models in which microbes play multiple and complex roles in both health and disease (Cadwell, 2015) . The global virome comprises 'the most abundant and fastest mutating genetic elements on earth', with the order of 10 31 'members' including viruses that infect host cells, viruses infecting non-viral organisms of the host microbiota, and virus-derived elements from chromosomes (Virgin, 2014) . It is suggested that to date only about 1% of the global virome has been identified (Mokili et al., 2012) , and that cellular host organisms are like 'islands in an ocean of the global virosphere' (Villarreal and Witzany, 2015) . In mammals, bacterial cells outnumber mammalian cells by approximately 10-fold, and the number of viral elements may be another order of magnitude higher.

 Since enteric coronaviruses infect intestinal epithelial surface, several questions still remain to be answered (Fig. 2) . Firstly, whether PEDV and PDCoV selectively activate and/or modulate IFN-production and whether IFN-plays a protective role on the intestinal surface. 
 IBV, though multiple inoculations were required and the rS1 protein induced only 50% protection of the kidney (Song et al., 1998) .

 The redistribution of nucleolar proteins plays an important role in nucleolar/ribosomal stress response (Russo and Russo, 2017) . GS cells infected RGNNV were fixed at 24 h and the intracellular localization of RGNNV capsid protein and NPM1 were examined by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 1D) . NPM1 protein was distributed in nucleus in mock-infected GS cell. 
 Elevation of temperature may playa role, because rising the temperature of measles virus infected cells from 35°C to 39°C resulted in immediate inhibition of M protein synthesis. 
 In particular, CD8 + CTL plays an important role in T cell immunity dependent protection against virus infections and the eradication of murine and human cancers [4, 5] . In the present study, a type II alveolar epithelial cell clone, T7, was used for analyzing precise mechanism of CTL against SARS CoV membrane antigens, as the SARS-CoV infects alveolar epithelial cell in the lungs [6] . Furthermore, the SCID-PBL/hu model, which is capable of analyzing in vivo human immune response, was also used because it is a more relevant translational model for human cases [4] . 
 It has been recently reported that ALVAC preferentially infects human cells of the monocytic lineage and was infact unable to infect human NK cells in vitro [18] . Our data indicates that in a mouse model, NK cells do play a crucial role in mediating the inflammatory response to ALVAC. 
 Poliovirus infects a wide variety of human cancer cell lines and primary explants [41] . By attenuation of a neurovirulent poliovirus strain by replacement of the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) with the corresponding sequence from the closely related human rhinovirus type 2, Gromeier et al. [179] were able to obtain a highly efficacious recombinant virus, PV1(PVS)-RIPO, which displayed significant tumor tropism and oncolytic potential in subcutaneous and i.c. human astrocytoma xenografts in nude mice. 
 Considering that dogs infected naturally were all between 45 and 56 days of age, it could be hypothesised that the age of the infected animals plays a role in determining the fate of CB/05 infection, with a very severe clinical course in the youngest pups. 
 IL-12, believed to be the principal Th1-type cytokine, is necessary for cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (Barchet et al., 2006) . IFN-g plays an important role in inducing immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects (Chen et al., 2009) . IL-10 is a predominant Th2-type cytokine that can downregulate IL-12 production and CMI (Yang et al., 2007) . In this article, the promotion of IL-12 and IFN-g secretion both in immature and mature Mo-DCs infected by SHXB and STC3 strains implied that Mo-DCs developed Th1 immune responses to TGEV infection, which was similar to the report that Rotavirus (RV)-infected DCs promote their capacity to induce the polarisation of allogenic naive T cells towards a Th1 response (Narvaez et al., 2005) . However, the virulent SHXB only produced a slight of IL-12 and IFNg, as little as possible to make the Mo-DCs clear themselves, while STC3, as a vaccine strain, induced the secretion of considerable cytokines to improve the immature Mo-DCs' immune response 
 Second, it is also possible that different genetics of the chicks in the field cases and of the chicks experimentally infected are responsible for the difference in tropism of the virus; it is believed that genetics of chickens play an important role in differences in IBV susceptibility and tropism (Ignjatovic et al., 2003) . It is believed that IBV mainly infects the respiratory and urogenital tracts, but it has long been known that IBV can be isolated from digestive organs, such as the proventriculus, intestines, and cloaca, and persists in the cecal tonsils (Ambali and Jones, 1990; Ambali, 1992; Montgomery et al., 1997) . Similarly, the results of this study showed that obvious positive immunohistochemical reactions developed not only in the cytoplasm of the tubular epithelial cells and in the mucous membrane of the ureters and collecting ducts in the kidney, and in the epithelial cells of

Soon after, real-time quantitative PCR assays were described and put in use for the diagnosis of SARS (Drosten et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . A host of measures were taken in order to contain this epidemic, and the molecular identification and diagnosis of the infectious agent by PCR played a key role in providing critical information to address the situation and contributed to the care of the patients infected . 
 of enzymes and cell proliferation [22] . Reports have shown that Bcl-2 expression is also by NF-κB [23] . As an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xl/Bcl-2l1 protein can directly inhibit channel activity by binding to VDAC on the mitochondrial membrane to stabilize it, inhibit cytochrome C release and block activation of the caspase family of proteins, and thus achieve the purpose of anti-apoptotic action; it can also inhibit Fas and Fas-mediated apoptosis [24] . The results of this study are consistent with the above findings wherein we demonstrated that PEDV infects the host and activated the NF-κB signaling pathway and subsequently, up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2L1 pathway which play a role in resisting apoptosis after PEDV infection. 
 by mutations in the CYLD gene [32] . Biochemical studies revealed that CYLD is a deubiquitylating enzyme acting on TRAF2 and TRAF6, which results in a negative regulation of NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor (TNFR) and toll like receptors (TLRs), suggesting that CYLD plays an important role in controlling inflammation [33] [34] [35] . Recent work uncovered that CYLD−/− mice are hypersensitive to infection by Non-typeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHi) [36, 37] . CYLD expression is induced in cells infected by this pathogen , and it was suggested to downregulate NF-κB activation through deubiquitylation of TRAF6 and 7, therefore preventing the formation of an antiviral response of the host. 
 Bronchial epithelial cells infected by RV also produce high amounts of the chemokines eotaxin and RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted), 28 which play a powerful chemotactic role in eosinophilic airway infiltration. 
 We now present data indicating that IFN-k also plays an important role in defense against several other human pathogenic viruses infecting the respiratory tract such as influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus and SARS coronavirus. 
 Consistent with the previous findings, a recent study has also shown reduced activity of lysosomal proteases including cathepsin D, N-acetylβ-D-glucosaminidase (β-NAG), and acid phosphatase in HFE-145 cells infected by H . pylori [96] . Disruption of lysosome acidification causes the repression of the retrograde trafficking of mannose-6-phosphate receptors which play an important role in carrying lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes in the trans-Golgi network [96] . However, the mechanism underlying the disruption of lysosome acidification in H. pylori infected cells is still unclear. 
 Furthermore, primarily BVDV infected animals could possibly play a more significant role in the spread of BVDV infection in the presence of co-infections. 
 This suggests that cytokine production by cd T cells during acute RSV infection may play a role in the development of recurrent wheeze after RSV infection. cd T cells form a minority of lung-infiltrating lymphocytes in mice infected by Sendai virus [59] , a paramyxovirus that causes nonfatal pneumonia. 
 SFV genomes display a high evolutionary conservation among all the species infected and SFV genetic variability within one infected animal is very low over time (<1% variation over 13 years) [28] . This genetic stability might be explained by the long co-evolution with their host [29 ] and their subsequent efficient adaptation.

Iversen et al.

When ace2 knock-out mice are infected with the SARS coronavirus, they were resistant to virus infection [13] . Virus titers from the lung tissues of infected ace2 knock-out mice were 10 5 -fold lower than those from the lungs of wild-type mice [13] . Moreover, none of the lung histology from ace2 knock-out mice challenged with SARS coronavirus showed signs of inflammation [13] , whereas some (but not all) SARS infected wild type mice displayed mild inflammation as defined by leukocyte infiltration [13, 26] . Thus, ACE2 is an essential receptor for SARS infections in vivo.

There is a progressive expansion of T cells in IFN-γ −/− mice infected with mycobacteria [5] . After Listeria infection, the frequency of antigenspecific T cells is higher in IFN-γ −/− mice than in wild-type mice [6] . Severe T cell-mediated immunopathology is observed in IFN-γR −/− mice infected by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [7] . Failure to suppress the expansion of the activated T cells in the absence of IFN-γ pathway leads to more severe encephalitis in mice [8] . Similarly, IFN-γ or its receptor deficient mice exhibit an increased susceptibility to MHV-induced hepatitis [9] [10] [11] . It has been hypothesized that the increased susceptibility is due to uncontrolled response to virus infection.

In addition, the S glycoproteins of these strains cause cell fusion between the target cells infected by viruses (3, 10) . The HE glycoprotein of DVIM possesses a hemagglutinating activity for binding to sialic acids on erythrocytes and an acetylesterase activity as a receptor-destroying enzyme as in the case of the HEF glycoprotein of in ̄uenza C virus (13) .

Another viral cause of severe ARDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (48) , especially in association with the North American Sin Nombre virus, features an unexplained preponderance of cases in young adults, which appears not to be attributable solely to higher rates of exposure (49, 50) .

Although SHFV LVR efficiently induced SHF disease in macaques in the 1960s , in a recent study, no correlation was observed between virus dose (ranging from 50 to 500,000 PFU/ml) and efficiency of induction of fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques (Johnson et al., 2011) . Bacterial sepsis was detected in 75% (12 of 16) of the SHFV-infected animals that did not survive suggesting that this played a major role in mortality. 
 Unexpectedly, a large portion of polarized MDCK II cells expressing Eps15 DN were not able to be infected by influenza virus ( Fig 3D) .

 MERSCoV and SARSCoV have also been found to infect more males than females. 19, 20 The reduced susceptibility of females to viral infections could be attributed to the protection from X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. 21 Additionally, about half of patients infected by 2019nCoV had chronic underlying diseases, mainly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes; this is similar to MERSCoV. 19 Our results suggest that 2019nCoV is more likely to infect older adult males with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune func tions of these patients. 
 During 2002-2003, SARS-CoV emerged as a global health risk which was speared over 29 countries infecting approximately 9000 people with 774 deaths worldwide [30] [31] [32] .

 SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus [1, 2] . The four structural genes of SARS are S gene, encoding a spike glycoprotein which plays a role in cell-cell fusion; small membrane protein (E), an integral membrane glycoprotein (M), and the N gene encoding a nucleocapsid RNA-binding protein that may be associated with viral M protein [3] . Presumably, SARS-CoV infects cells through the S protein, which binds to cell surface receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [4] . After this initial attachment, the viral E protein fuses with the plasma membrane of the host cell, and a cascade of intracellular events follows, including interaction between the M and N proteins [4] . Hence, these four structural proteins are major targets for developing anti-SARS drugs or vaccines. 
 Radiology technicians have a relative risk for a positive tuberculin skin test of 1·7 compared with other health-care workers, and those working for less than 1 year have a lower risk of infection, indicating that radiology technicians are more exposed to tuberculosis during their practice. 96 At the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong in March, 2003, at least 50 health-care workers, including radiographers, were infected by SARS . 97 Because imaging plays an important part in the diagnosis and management of HID, the role of the radiology department is to provide an immediate and effi cient radiological service for patients with suspected or confi rmed HIDs.
