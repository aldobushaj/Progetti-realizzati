" Previous serological studies have failed to find evidence of prevalent past MERS-CoV infections of humans (Gierer et al., 2013; Aburizaiza et al., 2013) , although a recent nation-wide study in Saudi Arabia has detected non-negligible numbers of individuals with antibodies against MERS-CoV, especially amongst shepherds and slaughterhouse workers (Müller et al., 2015) . We thus propose that MERS-CoV mostly infects , and recombines, in camels. "
" Most of them (95%) correspond to an interaction 17 between a human protein and a virus infecting humans (Table S1 ). "
" Since 95% of the VIPs were discovered for viruses infecting humans, it is possible that 24 the observed excess of adaptation in VIPs in mammals is due to higher rates of 25 adaptation exclusively in the primate branches of the mammalian tree ( Figure S1 ). "

" Starting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, which was later named 2019-nCoV (''n'' stands for novel), was found to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, asthenia and pneumonia among people in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020) . The first batch of patients infected by 2019-nCoV were almost all connected to a seafood market in Wuhan, which also trades wild animals. "
" While those approaches are limited to those particular species and do not scale to viral host-range prediction in general, the Host Taxon Predictor (HTP) (Gałan et al., 2019) uses logistic regression and support vector machines to predict if a novel virus infects bacteria, plants, vertebrates or arthropods.

" Strikingly, a model trained to distinguish between viruses infecting humans and viruses infecting other chordates (a phylum of animals including vertebrates) generalizes well to evolutionarily distant nonhuman hosts, including even bacteria. "
" Any virus infecting humans was assigned to the positive class, also if other, non-human hosts exist. "
" In this case, the negative class comprises only viruses infecting Chordata (a group containing vertebrates and closely related taxa). "
" Since in principle, the Human Blood Virome dataset should not contain viruses infecting non-human Chordata, a ""Chordata""-trained classifier was not used in this setting. "
" The models trained only on human and Chordata-infecting viruses maintain similar, or even better performance when evaluated on viruses infecting a much broader host range, including bacteria. "
" This model performs a bit worse on viruses infecting hosts related to humans, but achieves higher accuracy than the ""Chordata""-trained models and the best recall overall. "
" The generation interval, defined as the interval between the time when an individual becomes infected and the time when that individual infects another individual (Svensson, 2007) , plays a key role in shaping the relationship between r and R 0 (Wearing et al., 2005; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007; Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Park et al., 2019) ; therefore, estimates of R 0 from different models directly depend on their implicit assumptions about the generation-interval distribution and the exponential growth rate.

" To further explore whether above activities could be triggered after coronavirus infection, we analyzed the expression profiles of epithelial cells which was infected by SARS-CoV . "
" We first collected three differential gene expression data sets of hosts infected by HCoVs from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). "
" Ending the epidemic requires reducing the basic reproduction number (R) -the average number of people infected by each 2019-nCov-infected patient -to below 1, at which point transmission contracts and eventually burns out. "

Nevertheless, Ebola virus disease infected a tenth of one percent of the number of individuals believed to have been infected by the 1918 Influenza virus [4, 5] . While improvements in healthcare and public health measures, as well as changes in human behavior, partially explain the massive discrepancy between Ebola virus disease in 2014 and influenza in 1918 [6] , there is another critical difference between these two diseases: heterogeneity in the number secondary cases resulting from a single infected individual.

" The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, 35 which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 36 Apart from human, many animal species, such as bat, rat, camel, swine and hedgehog, can be 37 infected by different types of coronaviruses. "
" If each person infects n other people where n > 1 (the reproduction number), then the total number of cases should grow as n t/τ = e at , where τ is the incubation time, which depends on the characteristics of the particular disease. "
" The above experimental results are consistent with our structure modeling analysis, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 virus likely infects human cells through similar mechanisms as SARS-CoV virus by binding to human ACE2 with comparable affinities, and hence may possess similar transmissibility. "
" Together, our data demonstrates that the coronavirus receptors tend to share co-expression pattern across different tissues, consistent with the fact that CoVs infect similar types of cells and CoV-infected patients share similar clinical symptoms. "
" The gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection is nucleic acid detection [5] . However, the novel coronavirus mainly infects the lower respiratory tract and is difficult to sample. "
" Indeed, RNAaemia, defined as a positive result for real-time PCR in the plasma sample, was found in 15% COVID-19 patients 4 . It is reported that 6.7% patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 developed acute renal impairment and the mortality of SARS patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) was 91.7% 5 . Thus, the kidney impairment and outcome in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 , which resembles SARS in 2003, were urgently warranted. "
" The former two genera primarily infect mammals, whereas the latter two predominantly infect birds [2] . In addition to the 2019-nCoV, Betacoronavirus caused the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory author/funder. "
" Our most striking finding is that lymphocytopenia, which is common in acute infections, 9 is particularly significant in 2019-nCoV infections. 3 Others have demonstrated the correlation between the lymphocytopenia and the clinical severity. 10 Most previous reports only compared the severe groups against non-severe patients or heath controls; to further study this clinical feature, in our study, we compared the differences in the subgroups of lymphocytes harvested from COVID-19 patients with those from pneumonia patients not infected by 2019-nCoV . "
" According to a study in rats, the myeloid cells also express the 2019-nCoV receptor ACE2; 13 Moreover, recent imaging findings and postmortem biopsies reports indicate that the infection can potentially damage other organs than the lung, including the kidney, heart, liver and the testis. thus, we should consider the possibility of the virus infecting these cells, which is supported by the significant decrease in the platelet counts in both grade 2-group and grade 3-group COVID-19 patients and the reduced count of trilineage in the bone marrow .

" The 2019-nCoV causes symptoms similar to SARS based on recent clinical data [5, 6] , and is capable of spreading from human to human and between cities, with very contagious characteristic [11] . The mortality of the 27 included patients infected by 2019-nCoV was 37%, which is much higher than that reported 2% on 4 Feb 2020 [3] . "

" On the basis of her epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, chest images, and laboratory findings, this patient was diagnosed with SARS-COV-2 infected acute viral conjunctivitis and pneumonia. "
" Furthermore, Dr. Guangfa Wang, a member of the national expert panel on pneumonia, reported that he was infected by SARS-COV-2 during the inspection in Wuhan, through unprotected eye exposure. 17 Similarly, an anesthesiologist with insufficient eye protection confirmed with COVID-19 and also presented conjunctivitis as the initial symptom.

" Novel coronavirus pneumonia patients were firstly reported in Wuhan, Hubei in December 2019, and spread to all provinces in China and more than 20 countries in the following month [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . By February 20, 2020, COVID-19 has infected more than 70000 cases and led to more than 2000 deaths [6] . Based [7, 8] . The first COVID-19 patient in Shenzhen was admitted on January 9, 2020, and 416 cases have been confirmed by February 20, 2020 . Most of the confirmed cases were imported cases from Hubei province until now. "
" Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS-CoV. "
" A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV . "

" For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. "
" Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an etiologic agent responsible for the current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 . Over the past two months, the pathogen has infected over 88,000 people and caused at least 3,000 deaths. "
" The generation interval is defined as the time between when a person becomes infected and when that person infects another person (Svensson, 2007) ; therefore, the intrinsic generation-interval distribution g(τ ) gives the relative infectiousness of an average individual as a function of time since infection (Champredon and Dushoff, 2015) . Since g is a distribution, it integrates to 1, and the basic reproductive number R is thus the integral of K. "
" These intervals are not samples of the serial interval distribution, because it need not be the case that the PI infected the others. "
" Vink et al [17] used a mixture model in which ICC intervals t j − t pi can arise in four ways: (1) an outside case infects PI and j; (2) PI infects j; (3) PI infects an unknown who infects j and (4) PI infects unknown 1 who infects unknown 2 who infects j. "

" Viruses directly infect human kidney tubules to induce acute tubular damage. "
" Collectively, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects kidney tubules. "
" Over-expression of ACE2 lead to more efficient viral replication, but it was blocked by anti-ACE2 antibody in a dose-dependent manner 9 . A further study also confirmed that susceptibility to SAR-CoV correlates with ACE2 expression on cell lines 13 . In a subsequent work, Jia et al. showed that undifferentiated airway epithelial cells that express little ACE2 were poorly infected by SARS-CoV , while well-differential cells expressing higher ACE2 were readily infected 14 . Taking the evidence together, expression level of the ACE2 protein is associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection. "
" The demographic expansion of 3 3 9 SARS-CoV-2 during this period was consistent with the patients first diagnosed on 8 th 3 4 0 December, 2019 [4, 19] and the previously suggested most recent common ancestor 3 4 1 (TMRCA) dates for SARS-CoV-2 at 6 th December, 2019) [17] . Additionally, 3 4 2 considering that the virus has longest reported incubation period of up to 24 days [6], 3 4 3 the virus may had first infected humans in mid to late November, which is basically 3 4 4 consistent with the results of previous studies [25] . Therefore, in this study, EBSP 3 4 5 revealed that SARS-CoV-2 experienced an effective population size expansion since 3 4 6 7 th December 2019, which was also supported by a star-like network, EBSP, the 3 4 7 neutral tests (Fu''s and Tajima''s D test) and mismatch analysis.

" Family group (56 cases): Patients who had not been to Wuhan within 20 days since the illness started and were infected by acquaintances , mainly family members and other relatives, friends, and colleagues. "
" Stranger group (69 cases): Patients who had not been to Wuhan within 20 days since the illness started and had been infected by strangers . "
" Infections from strangers were the most dangerous and the hardest to control, since no one knew they were infected before onset, including the individuals infected . "
" COVID-19 is apparently more contagious than SARS and, without protection, people can be easily infected by close contact . "
" If they were infected by strangers , they will not be found until some people around them being infected and diagnosed. "
" Previously, an ongoing case study reported 59 patients infected by 2019-nCoV , including 28 severe cases and 3 death. "
" Our mean estimate is at 3.6, which means that on average 3.6 susceptible 78 individuals would be infected by one infectious individual . "
" When CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm 3 , patients with T cell depletion have increased susceptibility to fungal infections. 15, 16 It has been reported that SARS-CoV directly infects monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes in human. 17 The PLD may also be secondary to activation of T lymphocytes. 18 Our findings showed that CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes have significant difference (p < 0.01) between mild (Non-ICU) and severe or critical (ICU) cases without glucocorticoid treatment indicating COVID-19 directly effected on immune system is possible. "
" It has been reported that SARS-CoV directly infects monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes in human. 17 The PLD may also be secondary to activation of T lymphocytes. 18 COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity as SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors. 7, 19 The report shows SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2. 8 Therefore, it is necessary to further study whether lymphocytes have ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 expression during the developmental stage"
" Thus, the purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review of epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients infected by COVID-19 or MERS-COV disease, and to compare COVID-19 and MERS-COV in the context of their incubation, laboratory features, admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU) and rate of discharge and fatality, which will provide a comprehensive reference for clinical physicians in treatment of coronavirus diseases. "
" This result indicates that COVID-19 might be associated with cellular immune response, mainly act on lymphocytes like MERS-COV does [48] . The cells infected by viruses induce the release of numbers of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation storm in the body. "
" First, many patients infected by COVID-19 remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, leading to the unavailable of some data. "
" where β j is the rate at which a susceptible individual is infected by an infected individual in city j, α j is the rate at which a susceptible individual is infected by an exposed individuals in city j, κ j is the rate at which an exposed individual becomes infected in city j, and γ j is the recovery rate in city j, k I is the possibility of an infected individual moving from one city to another, and δ j is the eventual percentage of the population infected in city j. "
" Many epidemic models exist to describe spreads of infectious diseases mathematically [5] . The central role of modelling is to estimate the basic reproduction number, R 0 , defined as the expected average number of secondary cases infected by a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population, as well as the effective reproduction number, R t , defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case during an epidemic. "
" In this study we assumed voluntary home quarantine, which is showed to be about 50% effective in R0 reduction (16) , however there could be an increased risk of intra-household transmission infected people to contacts (24) , which is not considered in this model. "
" Wuhan is thought to be the site of earliest COVID-19 occurrence, and cases further afield were infected by SARS-CoV-2 carriers from Wuhan. "
" We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). "
" Generation intervals, which are defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person [8] , depend on the natural history of infection: individuals with subclinical infections may have fast clearance and short generation intervals, or slow viral reproduction and long generation intervals (cf. [9] ). "

" Adopting terminology of Teunis et al. [14] a transmission probability matrix V can be defined where element v i,j is the probability that subject i was infected by another subject j ; v i is a vector of transmission probabilities linking case i to any other case. "
" Elements of V can be estimated by utilizing a distance kernel κ i,j (X i,j |i ← j), that defines a pairwise likelihood that subject i was infected by subject j . "
" This alternating procedure can be repeated until no more improvement (in posterior probability) is found [14] . In the present analyses a special node (0) was defined, that has a uniform kernel κ i,0 : any subject can be infected by node 0 at any time, within a given time range. "

" Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. "
" In addition, we found that in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced production of IL-6, which has been reported previously to be of high relevance to the viral pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially for those intensive care unit (ICU) patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 . "
" Notably, current pathological studies have shown that the severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 generally have higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IFN-γ [25, 27, 28, 29] , implying a high risk of the inflammatory-associated cytokine storm after viral infection. "
" In addition, reduction and functional exhaustion of T cells have also been observed in COVID-19 patients [27] . Therefore, blocking the overactive inflammatory response may be an effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, particularly for those ICU patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 . "
" This finding indicates that CVL218 may also possess the IL-6 specific anti-inflammatory effect that is applicable to those severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 . "

" Primarily the virus infects the central nervous system but the NIV B strain has been shown to have significant respiratory involvement [2] . High mutation rate, human to human transmission, survival time of up to 4 days under various environmental conditions and lack of treatment makes it a potential bioterrorism agent [15, 16] . "

" However, if based on RT-dPCR, all the six patients can be diagnosed with COVD-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 and treatment could be conducted earlier. "
" The origin of the virus can be traced back to related strains predominantly found in bats (2) . Individuals infected by the disease can experience a series of symptoms, including cough, chills, fever, and shortness of breath (3) . From data currently available, fatal disease progression is higher than that of the common influenza strains and as such it resulted in more deaths than recent virus of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Search Results Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) combined.

" First, SARS-Cov-2 infects patients by binding human ACE2, 29, 30 which is widely expressed in multiple organs throughout the body. 31 SARS-CoV-2 might lead to multi-system inflammation through ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway. 32, 33 Second, it was reported that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses might also be involved in COVID-19.

"emergency of international concern 2 . The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 bears 96% 3 and 79.5% identity to that of a bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV, respectively 4 . Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus Coronavirus in the Corornaviridae family 5 . Clinically, several papers showed that most COVID-19 patients developed lymphopenia as well as pneumonia with higher plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe cases [6] [7] [8] , suggesting that the host immune system is involved in the pathogenesis 9, 10 . Patients infected by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV were previously reported to have antibody responses [11] [12] [13] [14] , but exhibited defective expression of type I and II interferon (IFN), indicative of poor protective immune responses [15] [16] [17] . However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. "
" Covid-19) was deeply confirmed as a pandemic [1] which is the 3rd announcement of the pandemic by WHO since 1948 [2] . A pandemic is a disease that is spreading in multiple countries around the world at the same time [1] . The same news has been announced in several Korean newspapers and TVs [2] . On the next day, Korea had reached more than 8,000 persons are infected by the Corona virus [3] . It has been panicking in Korea and still Koreans have panicked. "

"cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, in developed countries and particularly in the developing world [1] . According to the World Health Organization, out of the top-10 causes of death globally, three are infectious diseases [1] . In light of the continuous emergence of infections, the burden of infectious diseases is expected to become even greater in the near future [2, 3] Currently, the world is struggling with a novel strain of coronavirus that emerged in China during late 2019 and by the time of this writing has infected more than 156,000 people and killed more than 5,800 [4, 5] . COVID-19 is the latest and third serious human coronavirus outbreak in the past 20 years. "
" The onset of warmer weather in the northern hemisphere may modestly reduce rate of spread, but anticipation of a substantial decline in total number infected due to warmer temperatures alone is not warranted by these findings. "
" As of March 14th 2020, the virus has infected over 130,000 individuals in 122 countries, 3.7% of which had a fatal outcome (3) . The rapid identification of the etiology and the sharing of the genetic sequence of the virus, followed by international collaborative efforts initiated due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 have led to the rapid availability of real-time PCR diagnostic assays that support the case ascertainment and tracking of the outbreak (4) . The availability of these has helped in patient detection and efforts to contain the virus. "
" We then compared the improvement in absolute survival from treatment with the potential harm if COVID infected , and visualised these results. "
" Of the 9 scenarios, risk of death if COVID infected was higher than expected benefit in six of the seven, balanced in one and favoured chemotherapy in two cases. "
" Our model only requires oncologists to be able to specify the absolute improvement in overall survival, and then balance that against the predicted risk if the patient becomes COVID-19 infected . "

" Since the first cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, latterly named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO), were reported in Wuhan in December 2019, SARS-Cov-2 has infected 81174 patients and caused 3242 deaths in China. "
" Severe symptoms -population infected by SARS-CoV-2 with symptoms affecting their travel ability. 6. "
" Firstly, the virus infecting this family cluster case appeared low toxicity and low transmissibility. "
" Third, it has been reported that the ACE2-expressing cell ratio is variable between individuals, which may explain why some people are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 14 . This characteristic of ACE2 may explain why SARS-CoV-2 infected only one out of 26 newborns. "
" In this multicenter cohort study (StUdy of 2019 Novel coRonavirus pneumonia Infected critically ill patients in Sichuan provincE, SUNRISE), we aimed to analyze the epidemiology, clinical course and critical care for severe Covid-19 at the provincial level. "
"stool sample of the first US patient, indicating gastrointestinal tract infection (Holshue et al., 2020) . A recent study reported 14-53% cases with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the liver of COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Moreover, these symptoms were elevated in intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared to patients who did not require ICU (Huang et al., 2020) . It remains to be investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infect liver cells. "
" This is unfortunately the case for pathogens infecting humans, animals or even plants. "
" This virus has also infected more than 220,000 patients in all of the continents and over 180 other countries, such as Italy, Spain, U. "
" A very large group of patients infected by HBV has been reported worldwide, especially in China. "
" All enrolled cases were confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) testing. "
" From December 31, 2019 to March 18, 2020, the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) coronavirus pandemic has infected a reported 209,839 number of people, resulting in 8,778 deaths, in 168 countries around the world, and continue to spread exponentially 1 . While the world awaits the development of vaccines and anti-viral medications, traditional public health measures such as isolation of confirmed or suspected cases, quarantine of contacts, and social distancing of the public are effective measures to reduce viral transmission 2, 3 , that have been implemented in many regions and countries 4, 5 . "
" These rates are computed as the ratio of deaths due to COVID-19 to the number of people infected by the disease . "
" ( ) is a function accounting for the number of people infected in the city, which we assume is growing in time. is the infection rate when the person is infected by a co-worker , is the activation rate of the sickness, in which a patient in a latent state starts presenting symptoms. is the recovery rate, where an infected patient recovers and becomes healthy. is a function that accounts for the work output of the workers, for simplicity we assume its growth is proportional to the number of available workers. "
" The total infected fraction at the end of the epidemic as a function of R 0 is shown in Fig. 1(d) . For example, starting with a reference value R 0 = 2.4 with time to peak infection around 65 days, reducing R 0 by factor 2 to R 0 = 1.2, extends the time to peak infection to ∼ 320 days, while reducing the maximum infected fraction from ∼ 22% to ∼ 1.5% and the total infected by the end of the epidemic decreases from ∼ 90% to ∼ 30%. "
" Indeed, the haplotype network suggests the existence of direct transmissions among passengers who shared 35 same cabins during the quarantine; three cabin mates had been infected by the virus with same haplotype (two pairs in DP-A cluster, and one pair in other cluster), and 5 pairs shared haplotypes linked by a single SNV (A to DP0290, A to DP0481, A to DP0645, A to DP0803, and DP0764 to DP0765). "
" The ratio of COVID-19 infected to those in need of intensive or critical care is about 15%, and a third of them require mechanical ventilation [3] [4] [5] [6] . We will use 15% for our estimate. "
" However, the biological vectors of the strains infecting human are still unknown. "
"observation was corroborated by complementary gene expression analysis of over 250,000 bulk RNA-seq samples from GTEx 23, 24 and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) along with protein expression analysis from healthy tissue proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC) datasets [25] [26] [27] , where lung and other respiratory tissues consistently show lower ACE2 expression compared to the digestive tract and kidney (Figure S3A-D) . However, the respiratory transmission of COVID-19 along with the disease symptomatology and well-documented viral shedding in respiratory secretions 28 strongly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 indeed infects and replicates within these tissues. "
" Moreover, we found a marked suppression in total AT2 cells and CD44 + subpopulation in lungs from brain dead patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a mouse model infected by influenza viruses . "
" In a study on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), researchers found that EBV infected B cells had more LDH transcripts than the uninfected B cells (11) . In addition, the serum levels of LDH increased in PcP patients, probably was due to lung injury (12, 13) . Among patients who were infected during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 77.8% whose laboratory test showed LDH > 225U/L had lung involvement, without difference between adult and children (14) , which indicated that LDH elevation was associated with various pathogen including virus, and was relevant to lung injury. "
" The projected course of the epidemic in Wuhan, under the main analysis model, is shown in Figure 3 . We estimate that half the population was already infected by 27 January , and by 23 February only 585,000 susceptibles remained (95% CrI 555,000-617,000), meaning 94.7% of the population had been infected. "
" Here, we reported a higher prevalence rate of diabetes in these patients, which might be due to the larger proportion of geriatric patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in our study. "
" We estimated that at the end of the epidemic, a total of 65,572 (46,156-95,264) individuals would be infected by the virus , among which 16,144 (14,422-23,447, 24.6%) would be infected through public contacts, 45,795 (32,390-66,395, 69.7%) through household contact, 3,633 (2,344-5,865, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 783 (553-1,134) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,850 (1,801-4,981) medical staff members). "
" The epidemic curve of the onset of illness among cohort patients indicate a significant decrease in the number of both imported and local cases in Chongqing metropolitan area after Wuhan City shutdown since Jan 23, 2020 (Supplementary Figure 2) . Twenty-six (38.8%) patients were infected by household contact , 33 (49.3%) were from 10 familial clusters ( Table 1) . We estimated the median incubation period was 6.0 days (range 1-15 days). "
" [7] [8] [9] [10] Speculating that direct viral infection could trigger the observed changes in monocytes, we further investigated whether monocytes express ACE2 and therefore could be infected by the SARS-CoV-2 . "
" Since ACE2 is the receptor used by COVID-19 to gain entry to cells, this suggests the possibility that monocytes in patients with COVID-19 may be directly infected by COVID-19 , leading to abortive replication and a delayed type I IFN response in these cells. 12 Indeed, the SARS-CoV virus has been found to infect monocytes, though replication was poor. 14 Infection of monocytes by SARS-CoV was associated with inflammatory activation and alterations in immune function-related gene expression. 15, 16 Inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-α, GM-CSF, IL-6 or TNF-α can also stimulate the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. "
" The simulation results suggest that, under quasi-worst-case-scenario, the data for the number of people infected by COVID-19 is far more than reported: about 80% of (those infected but not isolated) are not accounted for. "
" Considering that other family members'' infection may cause emotional distress to the participants, we also collected the infection status of family members. 59 participants (41%) had one or more family members infected . "
" Podoviridae and Myoviridae are prokaryotic viruses infecting bacteria, Tymoviridae infect plants and Iflaviridae infect insects (ViralZone root-ExPASy) (Hulo et al., 2011) . We also used Z transformation of NGSRe-norm to define the precise location and rank of each viral family within the DM and HC distribution ( Figure 4D & 4E). "

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate AGI in critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 . "
" Asymptomatic ratio of Japanese nationals evacuated from Wuhan, who are more likely to be infected by the L type , is 30.8% (95% confidence interval: 7.7-53.8%). 6 In contrast, 51.4% (318/619) of RT-PCR confirmed cases among passengers in the cruise ship Diamond Princess, an outbreak traced to a Hong Kong passenger who is most likely to have S type virus, were asymptomatic (https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e/9417-covid-dp-fe-02.html).

" Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses, which contain RNA genomes, lack faithful proofreading mechanisms during replication and thus can produce a group of related but different viral strains infecting the same host. "
" The presence of selected best epitopes in all the reported human infecting SARScoronavirus strain were checked by using Epitope Conservancy Analysis tool of IEDB (http://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/) [41] .

" Here, we explore intra-host genomic variants and low-frequency polymorphic quasispecies in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 . "
" In this study we analysed NGS data derived from clinical specimens (oral swabs) from three Chinese patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (SRA projects PRJNA601736 and PRJNA603194). "
" Bioinformatics analysis of NGS data allows the generation of the consensus sequence of a viral genome from the of majority nucleotides at each position but also the identification of non-consensus nucleotides, enabling the exploration of intra-host variability but also its consequences on intra-host viral evolution [28] - [30] . All samples analysed in this study were probably infected by the same viral strain since they shared the same set of consensus SNVs. "
"5''-UGGUUUU-3'' and 5''-AAAACCAA-3'', have served as donor-acceptor sequences during the recombination event, since they are both exposed in the single-stranded internal loops formed in a highly structured RNA pseudoknot (Figure 3-C) . The RB domain of the S protein has been tested as a potential immunogen as it contains neutralization epitopes which appear to have a role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies [16] , [49] . It should be mentioned though that S protein of SARS-CoV is the most divergent in all strains infecting humans [50], [51] , as in both C and N-terminal domains variations arise rapidly, allowing immunological escape [52] . Our findings support that apart from these variations, the N-terminal region also hosts a recombination hot-spot, which together with the rest of the observed rearrangements, indicates the genomic instability of SARS-CoV-2 over poly-A and poly-U regions. author/funder.

" As long as Figure 1 : Graph showing the dependencies of the dynamic system describing the evolution of the numbers of undetected and detected infected persons (n i|u and n i|d , respectively), the numbers of undetected and detected recovered persons (n r|u and n r|d , respectively) and the number of fatalities (n k ). n s ≈ n s,init , the characteristic time scale (all time scales are in days) at which an infected person infects another one is 1/k i . Once n s becomes smaller, which happens quite quickly without any measures, the infection rate slows down by a factor of n s /n s,init . The rate q quantifies the number of persons being infected from outside, i.e., by travel or from the animal world. "
" Also, spreading does not necessarily have to be reduced to zero: Once every infected person infects less than one other person, the virus dies out. "
" Immunofluorescent double staining confirmed that the majority of NP antigen is found in ACE2 + cells and CD68 + macrophages, including cells in capillaries, while, neither CD3 + T cells nor B220 + B cells are positive for NP protein ( Figure 2B) . Moreover, immunofluorescent double staining also further illustrated that the viral NP antigen is observed in CD169 + macrophages in the subcapsular sinus of LNs ( Figure 2B) . Collectively, these results suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects macrophages, especially resident CD169 + macrophages in spleen and LNs. "
" The red pulp is markedly congested and hemorrhagic (Figure 3) . This phenomenon is consistent with older reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV. 27, 28 Taken together, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects LNs and spleens to cause severe tissue damage. "

" • We have considered, in our approximating branching process, that when 260 a new individual is infected by the reservoir during an excursion then only one individual is still infected. "
" However, we have to take into account the fact that there is at least one infected individual remaining in the population when a new individual is infected by the reservoir (otherwise the new infected individual would generate a new outbreak). "
" When a pathogen infects a novel host species, it finds itself in a new environment to which it must 142 adapt [4, 8, 10, 44] . When DCV was passaged through different species of Drosophilidae, we found 143 the same genetic changes arose repeatedly in replicate viral lineages in the same host species. "
" Therefore, mutations that evolve in one host 149 species frequently arise when the virus infects closely related hosts. "

" The general negative relationship between FIV Ple C and CDV/Babesia supports the theory that individuals infected by subtype C were more likely to die in the consequent Babesia/CDV outbreak (Troyer et al. 2011) .

" Some emergent viruses experience several hosts, often due to serial emergence events (18) . MERS-CoV is proposed to have host jumped from its natural reservoir (bats) into camels, then later spilling over to the human population (19) . Similarly, canine parvovirus jumped from infecting cats to raccoons and then jumped again to infect dogs (20) . Influenza strains have also serially shifted hosts (e.g., H3N8 originated from avian hosts infecting horses, and then shifting to dogs (21) ). "
" The evolutionary relationships between viruses with distinct host ranges are supported 745 not only by the phylogeny of the RdRp, but also by the fact that these viruses share additional 746 conserved domains, such as, for example, SJR1, S3H and 3C-Pro in the case of Picornavirales 747 members infecting protists, plants, fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates (Fig. 3) . 748 "

" Generation intervals, defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when 14 that individual infects another person, link two key quantities that describe an epidemic: 15 the reproductive number, R, and the rate of exponential growth, r. "
" These two quantities are linked by generation-interval distributions (9; 10; 11; 12; 13). 39 A generation interval is defined as the time between when a person becomes infected and 40 when that person infects another person (10). "
" A susceptible individual is thus relatively more 51 likely to be infected by a newly infected individual . "
" In the latter case, the high replication rate, coupled with the low fidelity of the viral polymerase in most RNA viruses, results in a group of different but related strains infecting the same host, which is often termed as ""quasispecies"" (Nowak, 2006) . Previous studies have revealed that patients with chronic virus infections, such as AIDS, are often the reservoir of new viral variants, which are likely produced during the replication process (MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2017) . Because different strains could have very different biological properties such as virulence, transmissibility, antiviral drug resistance etc, characterizing the genetic diversity within viral populations is very important for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.

" In the final multivariable model, cases who vomited infected 2.74 (95% CI: 1.90, 3.94) 270 more individuals than non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.62 (95% CI: 1.09, 2.41) more 271 individuals than cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.69 (95% CI: 1.18, 2.42) 272 more individuals than staff-cases (Fig 3) . In sensitivity analyses where cases with R Ei = 0 were 273 included in the regression analysis, stronger associations between infectiousness and vomiting, 274 diarrhea, and resident/staff status were observed (2.96, 1.90, and 1.89, respectively).

" In these assays, Guarani remarkably infected and successfully replicated with both Tupanvirus Deep Ocean and Tupanvirus Soda Lake after only one passage with each virus (Fig. 2a and 2b) . We interpreted this phenomenon as the result of a mechanism of host range expansion that allowed Guarani to replicate with new viral hosts previously resistant to this virophage. "
" This finding means that up to 24% of amoebas were successfully infected only by Tupanvirus alone without the virophage. "
" It also allows one to trace the 35 number of individuals the each pathogen infects [25] and, hence, to identify individuals 36 that may be acting as super-spreaders [31]. "
" Note that gamma E, gamma I, and gamma V are constants derived from parameters. gamma S, which governs the transition from Susceptible to Exposed, depends on the value of cell infect (i.e. the infectiousness of the environment); and gamma D, which governs the transition to Death, depends in part on agent stress.

"nih.gov"," Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household .

"nih.gov"," To illustrate the distinction between R c (t ) and R (t ), consider a situation where the transmission rate is abruptly reduced at a time t = t I . The instantaneous reproduction number R (t ), which estimates how many people one case would infect if circumstances were to remain fixed, would abruptly switch from a high to a low value at time t I . The case reproduction number R c (t ), on the other hand, estimates how many people each case actually infects . "

"nih.gov"," To provide a counter-balancing under-estimate of R * (r), I also consider an alternative approximation obtained by assuming the same total number of cases as predicted by this Reed-Frost model, but where all cases are assumed to be infected by the first index case . "
"nih.gov"," The probability of different chains of infection within households can easily be computed from the assumed Reed-Frost model [2] . I denote pr( {m 1 , m 2 , ..., m n }|n) the probability of a chain of infection occurring in a household of size n where m 1 index cases infects m 2 , who in turn infect m 3 tertiary cases and so on, up to a maximum of n generations of infection.

"nih.gov"," On the scale of other infections, this places influenza as being approximately as infectious as mumps, but a lot less infectious than either varicella-zoster or measles [1] . By applying the Reed-Frost model to these data with this distribution of households, I obtain estimates of the average number of infections in each generation of infection of m 1 u 1, m 2 = 0.64 (i.e. the first index case directly infects an average of 0.64 people in his or her household), m 3 = 0.19, m 4 = 0.036, m 5 = 0.0037 and m 6 = 0.00021, and thus the estimate for the total expected number of cases in an infected household is m = S 6 i = 1 m i = 1.87, to be compared to the mean size of 3.06.

This is expected since respiratory viruses need to be adapted to efficiently infect cells via the apical surface, which is the surface that is exposed to the respiratory Virus titer detected in the supernatant of influenza virus infected type I-like alveolar epithelial cells lumen, and therefore accessible to infection.

With the anti-E 4E11 antibody, monomeric and dimeric forms of the DV1 E protein could be readily detected whereas weaker signals were observed for the other three serotypes, because of limited affinity of the antibody ( Figure 8A ) [32] . E proteins of all DVs were detected using the mixture of sera ( Figure 8B ) with a signal of similar intensity, which suggested that RSPs of four serotypes could be generated to comparable levels. "

"
"nih.gov"," In contrast to the prominently elevated cytokine response, it has been rather challenging to detect any significant response of type I IFNs in individuals and mice infected by SARS-CoV [14, 15, 16] . Such a failure of SARS-CoV in inducing readily detectable type I IFN responses was subsequently demonstrated in many in vitro studies by using various cell types of non-pulmonary origins, including African green monkey kidney cells (Vero cells), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells, hepatoma Huh7 cells, and embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells [14, 18, 19, 20, 21] . Because type I IFNs have been shown to be effective against"
"nih.gov"," In an attempt to clarify the characteristics of the innate antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV, we also simultaneously analyzed the gene expression profile of 2B4 cells infected by Dhori virus (DHOV), an orthomyxovirus known to productively infect 2B4 cells, leading to profound production of IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines (Hill, et al., manuscript in preparation) . Contrary to the prevailing in vitro studies emphasizing the lack of readily detectable IFN responses, we find that 2B4 cells can mount an active response. "
"nih.gov"," Specifically, the expressions of IFN-l2 and IFN-b genes in SARS-CoVinfected 2B4 cells were more readily detected at the transcriptional rather than the translational levels ( Figure 8A) . Importantly, such disparities of the post-transcription efficiency among genes tested in this study were not inherited by 2B4 cells, as cells infected by DHOV were quite capable of expressing transcripts and proteins of IFN-l2 and IFN-b in a highly correlated manner ( Figure 8B and Hill, T. et al, in preparation). "
"nih.gov"," Taken together, these results suggest that while the expressions of IFN-l2 and, especially of IFN-b proteins, were profoundly inhibited, SARS-CoV infection did not impose a generalized suppression of host posttranscriptional machinery in 2B4 cells, an observation consistent with that reported for SARS-CoV nsp-1 protein [12, 64] . The failure of effectively translating IFN-b transcripts has also been reported recently in mouse fibroblasts infected by MHV stain A59 . "
"nih.gov"," Furthermore, epithelial cells seemed to be preferentially responsive to IFN-ls, when the latter results were compared to those from other cell types, thereby leading to the suggestion that IFN-ls exhibit some tissue and cell specificity [71] . Recent studies that compared the role of IFN-a/b and IFN-ls in the host innate immunity against respiratory influenza A virus versus hepatotropic Thogotovirus in IFN receptor knockout mice have indicated that IFN-ls contribute to the host defense viral pathogens infecting the lung but not the liver, further emphasizing a tissue-restricted manner of IFN-l-mediated antiviral responses [72] . Thus, the use of human bronchial epithelial 2B4 cells may be responsible for our success in identifying highly elevated expressions of IFN-l genes as a novel biomarker of SARS-CoV infection. "
"nih.gov"," IFN-b expression was induced to lower levels in IPS-1 2/2 neurons compared to wild type infected neurons at 24 (10-fold, p,0.05) and 36 hours pi (5-fold, p,0.05) despite the higher levels of virus replication (Fig 3A and 3B) . Expression of ISGs, (including RIG-I and MDA5) and IRF-3 target genes (including ISG56 and ISG49) followed this pattern and were dependent on IPS-1 for rapid and high level expression ( Fig 3C) . The presence of IFN-b and ISG transcripts in IPS-1 2/2 cells at 48 hrs pi is consistent with the finding"

"nih.gov"," MHV, like many other RNA viruses, replicates on double membrane vesicles [66] that are hypothesized to be this privileged site [42] . Transfection of 293T cells with RNA from MHV infected cells which contain high levels of viral dsRNA does not induce IFN-β while transfection of RNA from Rabies virus (RV) infected neuroblastoma cell lines or SeV infected 293T cells induces significant amounts of IFN-β mRNA (Figure 4) . IFN induction was dependent on 5'' triphosphate ends on viral RNA since treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase eliminated recognition of viral RNA (Figure 4) . These results suggest that even when MHV RNA is introduced directly into the cytoplasm, RLH are still unable to sense MHV RNA. "

Among all the cells producing IFN-I in response to herpesviruses, pDCs are characterized by the fact that their IFN-I production does not require endogenous virus replication [2, 40] . Moreover, pDCs are not productively infected by MCMV [13, 41] or HCMV [6, 7] . However, the resistance of pDCs to herpesvirus infection is not absolute. "

Anti-interferon activities have also been attributed to the NSs protein that may be elaborated in cells infected by serotypes that encode this protein [46] .

Importantly, consistent with the ability of HCV to induce autophagy in infected cells in vitro and supportive of the physiological and clinical relevance of the in vitro studies discussed in this review, Rautou et al. recently reported evidence for an increased autophagic response in the liver of chronically HCV infected patients relative to the normal liver and to patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and chronic hepatitis B infection [121] . Mechanism(s) are beginning to emerge to explain how HCV regulates the autophagy pathway [44, 46] and how it exploits autophagy proteins to initiate replication of the incoming viral genome [41, 43] and to attenuate RIG-I signaling [44, 45] .

"
"nih.gov"," Although mini-chromosome formation amongst the ssDNA viruses has only been definitively shown for parvoviruses [204] and geminiviruses [69] [70] [71] , it is probable that all the other nuclear localized eukaryote infecting ssDNA viruses also form such structures during the transcriptionally active portions of their life-cycles.

The antiserum identified a single protein band with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 12 kDa in BTV-8 infected cells, which is close to the molecular weight calculated for NS4, from the sequence of Seg-9 (,10 kDa). "
"nih.gov"," BTV-8 infected KC or BHK-21 cells and GIV infected BHK-21 cells all contain NS4, as revealed by western blot analyses and confocal microscopy, confirming the existence of a new and previously un-described protein, encoded by ORFx of orbivirus Seg-9. "
"nih.gov"," NS1 and NS3 play an important role in orbivirus exit mechanisms from infected cells [15] . BTV infects mammalian cells, usually resulting in a lytic infection, while infection of KC cells derived from the BTV vector Culicoides sonorensis, become persistently infected with little or no evidence of cell lysis [56, 57] . Previous work showed that intracellular expression of an NS1 specific antibody fragment (scFv) destabilised the formation of NS1 tubules in BTV infected cells [14] .

Since fecal samples from insectivorous bats were investigated, TM-2p might be a virus infecting insects rather than bats and gotten into stools after having been ingested through the diet [12] . Due to difficulties in alignment (only 210 aa of the less conserved part of NS1 protein of TM-2p virus were available) it was however not possible to compare this virus with our sequences. "

"nih.gov"," Type II pneumocytes are responsible for the production and secretion of surfactant to lower the surface tension of water and allow membrane separation, and insufficient pulmonary surfactant in the alveoli may result in alveolar collapse [28, 29] . The 1918 pandemic H1N1 and high pathogenic H5N1 viruses preferentially infect type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophage in mice [15, 30] . Alveolar macrophages may play a critical role in disease pathogenesis, not through production of infectious virus but rather through the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines that may further damage alveolar pneumocytes [31] . These phenomena suggest that viral cell tropism may determine the processes of ARDS. "

DENVs entering THP-1 cells via Fc receptors suppressed type I interferon responses and the activation of cellular antiviral molecules more effectively than DENV infecting the same cells in the absence of antibody [95] [96] [97] . Moreover, THP1 cells infected in the presence of antibody produced more infectious virus per infected cell compared to cells infected in the absence of antibody. "

Boonak and colleagues compared ADE infections in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells and observed increased IL10 production in primary monocytes but not in macrophage or dendritic cells [98] . The picture emerging from these studies is that antibody-complexed dengue viruses infecting cells via Fcγ receptors leads to the suppression of cellular antiviral responses but further studies are needed to better define the cellular pathways and mechanisms that contribute to this phenotype.

"nih.gov"," Infection with RNA viruses that may cause encephalitis in humans, such as HIV or lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses, or in rodent models, such as mouse hepatitis virus and Theiler''s virus, can directly induce the expression of chemokines by astrocytes and microglia and establish chemokine gradients that promote leukocyte trafficking within the CNS [11, 31, 32, 33] . In addition, neutralization of CXCL10 decreased leukocyte migration to areas of infection in measles virus-infected brain tissue [34] . Although several of these viruses directly infect neurons, these cells have not been observed to participate in the inflammatory response, suggesting the indirect induction of inflammatory response via cytokines.

The quantities of important cytokines secreted in pigs infected by PRRSV appeared to be significantly lower than pigs infected with a swine influenza virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus [3] [4] [5] . Natural killer (NK) cell, a lymphocyte subpopulation, provides a first line of innate defense against virus infection [6] . In pigs, NK cells are small to medium sized lymphocytes and they lack adequate intracellular granules [7, 8] . Therefore, although younger pigs possess a higher frequency of NK cells, they have reduced NK cytolytic activity [9] ."

In vivo, MHV-A59 is strictly dependent on CEACAM1 for infection [27] , but persistent infection of murine cells leads to the emergence of viruses with extended tropism [28] . The MHV/BHK virus infects cells in a heparan sulfate-dependent and CEACAM1-independent manner because of the acquisition of two heparan sulfate binding sites in the S protein [29, 30] . It has been shown that both binding sites are required to acquire the CEACAM1-independent phenotype [30] . "

"nih.gov","SARS coronavirus was traced to caged civets in the market [3] , and later Chinese horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus sinicus, was suggested to be a likely reservoir of SARS coronavirus [4] . Bats are ideal incubators for new emerging infectious agents as they are mammals which roosted together and can fly over vast geographical distance [5] . This has reignited the interest in seeking for new bat viruses including many bat coronaviruses and the recent discovery of bat influenza virus [6] . Besides the SARS coronavirus, viruses in bats often infect human through intermediate hosts such as horses for Hendra virus, pigs for Nipah virus, and chimpanzees for Ebola virus [5] . It is therefore important to catalogue as comprehensively as possible the animal viruses present in wild life especially the bats and birds, the food animals such as pigs and cattles, the pet animals such as cats and dogs, and monkeys which are phylogenetically close to humans.

The similar clinical presentations of patients infected by various respiratory viruses make etiological diagnoses difficult when doctors simply make decisions based only on physical symptoms [10] [11] [12] .

"nih.gov"," In addition, it is expected that larger particles will tend to fall out of the air and contaminate surfaces, by which individuals may be infected by contact or may transmit the particles to a secondary aerosol [4] . Fundamentally, aerosols are suspensions in the air of solid or liquid particles small enough that they will remain transmissible and airborne for a prolonged period of time [23] . Particles of 5 μm or less increase the risk of establishing an infection upon airborne transmission, as they are remarkably capable of penetrating the physical cellular barrier of the respiratory tract and traveling all the way to the alveolar region.

"nih.gov"," The sera from rabbits immunized with recombinant ORF3a (a.a. 125-274) does not exhibit any significant neutralizing activity on SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells [59] . In another study, however, sera from rabbits immunized with a different recombinant ORF3a (a.a. 15-28) contains neutralizing antibodies that do inhibit SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells [61] . These contrasting results could be explained by differences in the immunogenicity of the central region and C-terminal domain compared to the N-terminal ectodomain, respectively. "
"nih.gov"," The genes up-regulated in the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 infected pigs'' TBLN were associated in 18 networks: from biological networks with functions associated with cell death, antimicrobial responses and cancer, with the highest network score of 37, i.e. the likelihood of genes in this network would have approximately a 10 -37 chance of occurring randomly, and 21 focus molecules, i.e. the starting points for generating biological networks; to networks with functions associated with nervous system development and function, organ morphology and reproductive system disease with a score of 2 and 1 focus molecule. "
"nih.gov"," The downregulated network functions in the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 infected TBLN included activities associated with cellular function and maintenance, tissue morphology, metabolic disease, organismal development, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, post-translational modification, protein folding, developmental disorder, which may be associated with cell death and reflects a severe disease state.

"nih.gov"," PRRSV infects pigs of all ages and is caused by a highly mutating, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus belongs to the family Arteriviridae [6] . PRRS in growing pigs causes anorexia, fever, respiratory distress, and enhanced susceptibility to secondary microbial infections; while in pregnant sows it is characterized by reproductive dysfunction and abortions [7] . Primary PRRSV permissive cells are alveolar macrophages (Mws) [8] . PRRSV rapidly modulates the host innate immune response, such as dampens the NK cell cytotoxicity and reduces the IFN-a production,"
"nih.gov"," We also analyzed ingestion of PR8 virus infected apoptotic ATII cells by AM, cytokine levels by ELISA, glutathione levels, necrosis and apoptosis by TUNEL assay. "
"nih.gov"," To test this hypothesis we used adenovirus Nrf2 (AdNrf2) and Nrf2 siRNA strategies to study the effect of Nrf2 overexpression and knockdown, respectively in these cells infected by PR8 virus . "
"nih.gov"," Plaque assay was performed as we previously described [32] . Briefly, medium from PR8 virus infected ATI-like cells was serially diluted in DMEM and used to inoculate Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. "
"nih.gov"," Our initial study was simply to document that ATI-like cells could be infected at comparable levels to our previous observations with ATII cells [19] . We used cytokeratin MFN 116 as a marker of ATI-like cells, and we found that PR8 virus readily infected these cells (Figure 1 ) similar to what we have observed with ATII cells. "
"nih.gov"," Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, and high mortality in the piglets [1, 2] . PEDV is known for the family of Coronaviridae containing enveloped, singlestranded RNA [3] [4] [5] . Most of newborn piglets infected by PEDV would die and pigs of all ages are also affected and exhibit severe symptom like massive diarrhea and dehydration, resulting in serious damage in the swine industry [6] [7] [8] . Until now, there are no effective treatments or vaccines developed to prevent economic loss by PEDV. "
"nih.gov"," It might be tempting to use hospital data to calculate the observed number of co-infections in relation to expected numbers based on the assumption that infections with different viruses occur independently of each other within the total number of hospital specimens [9, 23, 25, 26] . However, these estimates do not take into account the incidence in the catchment population nor the hospitalization rate of the children infected by the respective viruses . "
"nih.gov"," Differentiation results in pseudo-stratified and polarized cultures, containing ciliated, secretory, and basal cells that resemble human airway epithelium [47, 48] . Interestingly, Matrosovich et al. [48] , using this differentiated cell system, were able to show that avian and human influenza viruses infect different cell types as a consequence of their different receptor specificity (SAα2,3 and SAα2,6, discussed in the next section). "
"nih.gov"," It is well established that IAV infect human monocytes and macrophages, leading to high production of cytokines [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . These immune cell types are critical for the induction of the innate immunity in the host. "
"nih.gov"," Thitithanyanont et al. [60] showed that either blood isolated myeloid DCs (mDCs) or MDDCs can be infected by H5N1 IAV , resulting on the induction of high levels of IFN-α and, importantly, leading to cell death. "
"nih.gov"," Macrophages and DCs, due to their high expression levels of PRRs, are likely to significantly contribute to the induction of the rapid and severe damage observed in human infected by H5N1 viruses by recruiting other immune cells via chemokine production, as monocytes and neutrophils, and stimulating the cytokine amplification in epithelial and endothelial cells. "
"nih.gov"," H5N1 viruses infect epithelial, endothelial and inmmune cells, which upon recognition of viral PAMPs produce high levels of cytokines and chemokines. "
"nih.gov"," Most Alphacoronaviruses, including AcoV, utilize Aminopeptidase N of their natural host as a receptor, and host tropism differences of viruses are caused by the ability of their spike proteins to detect small species-specific amino acid differences in the aminopeptidase N [8, 13] . Despite the host specificity of this receptor, all of those viruses are known to bind and utilize feline Aminopeptidase N, suggestive of a common coronavirus ancestor infecting feline species [30] . This would explain the ability to grow ACoV on feline origin cell lines, such as Crandell-feline kidney cells (CRFK) [31] , and the failure to propagate virus on numerous other mammalian cell lines [1] . "
"nih.gov"," In a co-infection study with PCV2 and PRRSV, instead of observing an enhanced effect, PCV2 reduced PRRSV replication and PRRSV-associated cytopathy by inducing IFN-α production in swine AMs [14] . Such findings, however, do not reflect and explain the enhanced clinical disease observed in PRRSV and PCV2 dually infected cases in the field. "
"nih.gov"," Although ER stress and the UPR are evident in the course of productive infection by African swine fever virus (ASFV, DNA virus), PERK activation seems not to be induced (Galindo et al., 2012) . In Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells infected by ASFV , the eIF2α phosphorylation is maintained at a lower level in order to restore protein translation (Galindo et al., 2012) . Furthermore, ASFV is capable of blocking the expression of CHOP induced by DTT, thapsigargin, and other agents (Netherton et al., 2004) . ASFV also encodes the viral protein DP71L, a homolog to GADD34 (Zsak et al., 1996) . However, it is not clear if DP71L also involves in the inhibition of PERK activation. "

This proteolytic processing releases its cytoplasmic DNA-binding domain, ATF6f (a fragment of ATF6), which operates as a transcriptional activator that upregulates many UPR genes related to protein folding ( Figure 5 ) (Haze et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2007) . As mentioned above, replication of HCV subgenomic replicons suppresses the IRE1-XBP1 pathway (Tardif et al., 2002 (Tardif et al., , 2004 . However, in cells infected by HCV replicons , subgenomic replication results in the activation of the ATF6 pathway, indicated by the presence of a 50 kDa protein, a cleavage product corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of ATF6 (Tardif et al., 2002 (Tardif et al., , 2004 . As a result, there is an increased transcriptional level of chaperones such as BiP. "

"nih.gov"," By the end of the third week in April, it was confirmed that patients who had influenza or pneumonia symptoms were infected by the same H1N1 virus in Texas and Mexi- co [12] . The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that this virus was a different type than the previous ones found in pigs and humans [13] . According to this announcement, influenza A prevention systems were activated all over the world. "
"nih.gov"," On the other hand, that MO apoptosis represents an innate immune response of the host is suggested by decreased viability of bacilli in apoptotic MO [5] [6] [7] . There is also evidence that dendritic cells that have ingested apoptotic MO infected by Mtb can activate T cells through a process known as crosspriming which results in the activation of CD8+ T cells [7, 8] . It is also of interest the identification of Mtb proapoptotic mutants that induce higher T cell immunity which favors the control of infection [9] . "

"nih.gov"," At least three SwIV subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are currently circulating in the swine population despite regular vaccinations, and exchange of influenza viruses between human and swine is common and not a one-way street [1, 2] . The traditional vaccine is less effective because it cannot possibly include all the strains actively infecting people in the world. "
"nih.gov"," However, a recent report on the pathogenesis of seasonal influenza virus H1N1 in ferrets shows that this virus is also present in the intestine [10] . Furthermore it is world acknowledged that avian influenza viruses frequently infect in the intestine of the avian host [2] . Therefore it appears justified to include influenza viruses in studies on the probiotic inhibition of virus multiplication both in vitro and in vivo. "

"nih.gov"," Control of viral CNS infections is dependent on CD8 T-cell effector function in numerous rodent models [19, [41] [42] [43] [44] . Because many neurotropic viruses infect resident cells capable of upregulating MHC class I, but not class II molecules, effector mechanism are thought to result from direct target-cell/T-cell interactions. "
"nih.gov"," Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most commonly reported trigger of HPS [24] . The epidemiology of EBV-related HPS is not well known, although a higher incidence has been observed in Asian countries, where it has been theorised there may be a more pathogenic viral strain that is genetically similar to the strains observed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines [25] . Two forms of EBV-related HPS have been described: the first occurring during primary infection and the second during a reactivation process [26] . During primary infection, EBV typically infects and replicates in B cells, whereas EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells are required to produce memory cells. "
"nih.gov"," During a single-cycle infection, human influenza viruses preferentially infect nonciliated epithelial cells, whereas avian viruses, as well as the egg-adapted human virus variant with avian virus-like receptor specificity, primarily infect ciliated cells. "
"nih.gov"," This suggests that HBoV is not a frequent commensal virus inhabiting the respiratory tract [16, 19] . HBoV infections are frequently present in concomitant with other viruses and often occur in more than 50% of the tested samples [31] . In the current study, only one case was found to be infected only by HBoV as a single virus entity while most of isolates (17/18) showed coinfection with other viral pathogens. "

"nih.gov"," The presence of WUPyV and KIPyV in samples from children but not from immunocompetent adults suffering from LRTIs suggests that these viruses primarily infect the young population [100] . A correlation between immunosuppression and reactivation of the two novel polyomaviruses has been suggested in immunocompromised patients [101] and in AIDS patients at the molecular level [102] , but no evidence of a role of these viruses as opportunistic pathogens has been given. "
"nih.gov"," Symptoms of patients infected with this new strain were mainly bronchiolitis, wheezing, and asthmatic exacerbation in cases from Australia and Hong Kong, which peaked in fall and winter whereas in New York the new rhinovirus genotype was detected in cases of influenza like illness (ILI) that were clustered within an 8-week period from October to December [62, 107, 108] . A recent study describes a clinical case of severe respiratory and pericardial disease in an infant infected by HRV-C suggesting tha viral tropism is not strictly restricted to the respiratory tract [109] . A study focusing on the global distribution of novel rhinovirus indicates its association with community outbreaks and pediatric respiratory disease also in Africa and in symptomatic subjects living in remote locations having limited contacts with other human populations. "
"nih.gov"," During the A/H1N1v flu wave, due mainly to the lack of cross-neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies [143, 144] or the presence of co-morbidities, more children and younger adults were infected by the pandemic flu strain and had serious disease than in the seasonal epidemic. "

"nih.gov"," Estimation is based on two simple summary statistics, the proportion infected by the natural reservoir among detected cases (G) and among the subset of the first detected cases in each cluster (F). "
"nih.gov"," Whilst viruses causing such ''''spill-over'''' infections are usually poorly adapted for sustained human-to-human transmission, they are under strong selection pressure to increase transmissibility once in humans [4] . If the reproduction number R (i.e., the average number of persons infected by a case ) evolves to exceed 1, a large scale epidemic in humans may result. "
"nih.gov"," Our method relies on the observation that the proportion of detected cases that are infected by the reservoir is largely determined by the reproduction number for human-to-human transmission, R. "
"nih.gov"," We propose to estimate R from two simple summary statistics, the proportion infected by the natural reservoir among detected cases (G) and among the subset of the first detected cases in each cluster (F). "
"nih.gov"," Following Lloyd-Smith et al. [12] , the offspring distribution (i.e., number of persons infected by a case ) is modelled with a negative binomial distribution with mean R and overdispersion parameter k (parameter k characterizes case-to-case variation in infectiousness). "

"nih.gov"," For scenario 2, we denote the number of clusters that are investigated by M and the number of first detected cases of each cluster that were infected by the reservoir by m. "
"nih.gov"," If the detection of a case does not affect detection of other cases from the same cluster (surveillance scenario 1), we find that R can be simply estimated as R = 12G, where G is the proportion of detected cases that are infected by the reservoir . "
"nih.gov"," For situations where detection of a case may increase the probability of detecting other cases in the same cluster (surveillance scenario 2), we estimate R from the proportion F of first detected cases in each cluster that were infected by the reservoir . "

"nih.gov"," In particular, modifiedlive vaccines are generally effective against homologous strains but variable in success against heterologous strains, while efficacy of inactivated vaccines in the field is more limited and restricted to homologous strains [9] . In addition, PRRSV has developed diverse mechanisms to evade porcine antiviral immune responses [10] . Once the virus infects pig tissues, it has several mechanisms to evade the pig''s immune system, causing a several week delay in protective antibody production [11] [12] [13] . In the absence of control efforts, the virus will persist indefinitely in swine herds. "
"nih.gov"," These different pathogens may target different parts of the gastrointestinal tract, which may influence the symptomatic manifestations of the disease [17] .

"nih.gov"," Canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) are closely related viruses that have been included in the unique species Feline panleukopenia virus together with other antigenic and genetically related viruses, such as raccoon parvovirus (RPV), raccoon dog parvovirus (RDPV), blue fox parvovirus (BFPV) and mink enteritis virus (MEV) [1, 2, 3] . All together, these viruses infect a wide range of domestic and wild species of the order Carnivora [2] . VP2, the major structural protein of the viral capsid, determines the pathogenicity, tissue tropism and host ranges of this virus subgroup [4, 5] . FPLV was originally identified in domestic cats [6] and later on other large felids, such as tigers, panthers, cheetahs and lions [2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] .

"nih.gov"," A variety of events have been described that contribute to the formation of RNA recombinants (Figure 1) . Such events include crossovers between viruses belonging to the same or to different taxonomic groups, between viruses infecting different hosts, or from adopting genetic material from the host. "
"nih.gov"," One recombination process that was addressed with plant viruses has been the events between an invading virus and the transgene mRNAs in transgenic plants (Aaziz and Tepfer, 1999) . One such example being recombination between two strains of CMV where one strain was expressed as a transgene while the other strain infected the transgenic plant (Turturo et al., 2008) . This research group has also described recombination between related viruses (CMV and tomato aspermy virus TAV), with the population of recombinants being similar to each other in transgenic and in nontransgenic plants, suggesting similar molecular mechanisms of recombination (Jacquemond, 2012) . In general, this demonstrates that transgene viral mRNAs enter the same pathway as do natural viral RNAs, most likely operating in the cytoplasm. "

The existence of distinct ""high virulent-low virulent FCoVs"" is an alternate and less popular hypothesis for FIP pathogenesis [5, 10] . As FIP occurs sporadically and outbreaks of FIP in domestic cat populations are rather uncommon, there has been little epidemiologic support for this hypothesis [1] . "

This is not true of all viruses however, for TMV infects species from 30 different families, yet shows little segregation into strains (Kearney et al., 1999) ; it is possible that the evolution and diversification of viruses into strains differs markedly between those infecting annual hosts that are removed or die at the end of a growing season, and perennial species in which an infection can persist for decades.

"nih.gov"," A Phase 2b trial, termed STEP with an hAd5-based vaccine expressing antigens of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) not only showed lack of efficacy in spite of the vaccine''s immunogenicity, but also indicated an increased trend in HIV acquisition in individuals with circulating hAd5 neutralizing antibodies prior to vaccination [56] . Antibodies against the hexon protein dominate the neutralizing response elicited when humans are infected by Ad [57] . The hexon protein is composed of seven short hypervariable regions (HVRs), each of which can elicit a serotype-specific immune response [58] . Alternative serotypes from humans or nonhuman primates (NHPs), to which most of population lack pre-existing immunity against the relevant hexon protein, have been vectored and may circumvent the problems encountered with using hAd5 vectors in humans [44] . Thus, the use of uncommon Ad serotypes should bypass the issue of pre-existing immunity. "

One of the possible reasons for these poor results is the extent to which viruses infect targeted cells. "

Ex-vivo infections of human lungs and human airway epithelial cell cultures identified type II alveolar cells and non-ciliated lung epithelial cells (Clara cells) as the targets of infection, rather than the ACE2-expressing ciliated epithelial cells that SARS-CoV targets [9, 15] . Interestingly, in at least one case, endothelial cells were infected as well [15] , showing a distinct difference between the biology of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as SARS-CoV specifically infects ciliated epithelial cells in the lung [17, 18] . The receptor for MERS-CoV was recently identified as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) by mass spectrometry analysis of Huh7 cell protein bound to the MERS-CoV Spike protein in vitro [10] . Transfection and localization experiments demonstrated that DPP4 is indeed the receptor for MERS-CoV and is necessary for infection of a non-permissive cell line [10] . DPP4 has many diverse functions in glucose homeostasis, T-cell activation, neurotransmitter function, and modulation of cardiac signaling [19] . ACE2 does not"

Injection of anti-DNGR-1 monoclonal antibody-OVA conjugate into mice was endocytozed by CD8+ DCs, presented antigen to CD4+ T cells, and played a major role in the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells [147] . The addition of the adjuvant poly I:C enhanced IL-12 mediated immunity, whereas the adjuvant curdlan primed Th17 cells [147] . In addition, vaccinia virus infected dying cells are endocytozed by DNGR-1 on DCs and mediate cross-priming of antivaccinia virus infected cell CD8+ T-cell responses; loss of DNGR-1 impairs CD8+ CTL responses [148, 149] . Thus, DNGR-1 regulates cross-presentation of viral antigens and could be further assessed as a target for vaccination protocols. "

Vitamin D inhibits NF-B signalling which is responsible for RSV inflammation without affecting the antiviral activity of the host [138] . Lower levels of micronutrients like zinc, copper, selenium and retinol (Vitamin A), and alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E) were observed in the children affected by RSV and human metapneumovirus [139] . In one study, RSV infected children were administered vitamin A to compensate the lower vitamin A serum level which was found beneficial for children with severe RSV infection [140] . Also, probiotic diet has shown to boost resistance against pathogen by modulating immune response, as in case of RSV, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (a probiotic bacteria) treated BALB/c mice showed significantly reduced lung viral loads and pathology after the RSV challenge [141] .

In the first case, the two PToV-HE lineages were detected even within the same animal at two sequential sampling time points, indicating that both PToV strains carrying different HE proteins coexisted on the same farm infecting the same piglets, and suggesting that the immune response generated against one PToV strain did not protect the animals against the infection by the other strain. "

In addition, CD4+ T cells isolated from rectal and cervical tissue exhibit considerable heterogeneity in expression of the surface integrin a4b7, which can specifically bind the V2 loop of the HIV envelope protein gp120 and may improve cell-to-cell spread by activating other cellsurface molecules in the viral synapse [39] . Experiments in vitro indicate that HIV preferentially infects cells expressing high levels of CCR5 and that infection can be further enhanced by high levels of surface a4b7 expression in some individuals [40, 25] .

It is caused by a type of human coronavirus called MERS-CoV, a new member in the lineage C of -coronavirus ( -CoV) [2] . So far (until 15 July, 2014), 688 patients have been infected by MERS-CoV globally where 30% people already died [1, 3, 4] . Some recent studies [5, 6] indicate that bats and dromedary camels are potential host to transmit virus to human. "
"nih.gov"," Epidemiologic surveys of wild mice showed that MPyV, like its human counterparts, is a widely prevalent, harmless pathogen in its natural host reservoir (117, 118) . MPyV infects a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal cells (119) , macrophages, and DCs, but not lymphocytes (120) . Neuroectodermal lineage cells were stated to be non-permissive for MPyV replication (119), but evidence for this host cell range restriction is lacking. "

In the case of HCV, it has been previously shown that patients with chronic HCV infections express ISGs, including high levels of ISG15 (97) (98) (99) . In fact, HCV has evolved to use some ISGs for viral replication (100, 101) . This is the case for ISG15. "

The flavivirus that causes dengue fever infects up to 100 million people each year, leading to death in 2.5% of cases 3, 4 . Other viral outbreaks including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV), affect far fewer people but have high mortality rates and the potential to spread to epidemic size 1,5,6 . Thus, even with the development of vaccines and other treatments, viruses lead to a large burden on human health. "

"nih.gov"," Fulminant apoptotic cell death for both cell clones on tunicamycin treatment revealed that the JEV persistently infected cells still contained functional arms for cell fate decisions. "
"nih.gov"," Many viruses that are originally cytopathic have been found to lose their cytopathicity when the persistent infection is established [2] . JEV infection induces severe cytopathic effects in various cell culture systems, including BHK-21 cells, and researchers have documented the ER stress response and subsequent apoptosis in the JEVinfected cells [31, 32] . In order to assess how much of the JEV persistently infected BHK-21 cell population is destined to apoptosis while continuously producing infectious virus particles, the two BHK-21 cell clones with JEV persistent infection-cBS6-2 and cBS6-3-were subjected to flow cytometry analysis after annexin V/propidium iodide staining. "

"nih.gov"," Phosphorylation of eIF2α often leads to inhibition of protein translation in general, but the translation of ATF4 is promoted by p-eIF2α [35] . This phenomenon was reconfirmed in this experiment as the expression of ATF4 increased gradually 6 hr p.i. in JEV acutely infected cells (Figure 2A) . CHOP, the key mediator of ER stressinduced apoptosis, was also induced and accumulated gradually along with the ATF4 activation. "
"nih.gov"," In contrast, for the JEV persistently infected cell clones, the expression of CHOP was not detected at all, even in the presence of ATF4 for its transcription (Figure 2A ). "
"nih.gov"," It was noteworthy that a much higher level of BiP was maintained in both JEV persistently infected cells throughout the culture period. "
"nih.gov"," To further investigate whether the JEV persistently infected cell clones kept the UPR pathway intact, naïve BHK-21 cells and the two cell clones with JEV persistent infection were treated with 0.5 μg tunicamycin mL −1 for 24 hr. "
"nih.gov"," Taken together, these results suggest that the JEV persistently infected cells avoid fulminant apoptosis by maintaining a constant, highly-elevated level of BiP, which results in the complete suppression of CHOP induction. "
"nih.gov"," Based on the observations, there was no detectable CHOP expression during continued virus replication in the JEV persistently infected cells ( Figures 1B, 2A , and Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). "
"nih.gov"," In this study of JEV persistently infected cells compared to an acute infection in normal BHK-21 cells, the most distinguishable aspects regarding the UPR factors were the complete depletion of CHOP and the constant upregulation of BiP expression (Figure 2A and Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). "
"nih.gov"," Some previous studies also showed that BiP overexpression attenuates ER stress signaling and is protective against apoptosis [37] . Therefore, we decided to assess the implications of the constant expression of BiP for maintaining cell viability against virus-induced apoptosis in the JEV persistently infected cells. "
"nih.gov"," In addition, the numbers of viable cells decreased significantly in both cell lines according to cleavage of caspase-3 ( Figure 4A and B) . The results suggest that the constant overexpression of BiP in the JEV persistently infected cells somehow holds back CHOP expression, resulting in the prevention of virus-induced apoptosis. "

"nih.gov"," With advances in methods aimed to detect pathogens, some pediatric patients with ALRT infections are infected simultaneously by multiple pathogens [10, 11] . And it is suggested that co-infections are medically relevant, and effective treatment for severe respiratory tract infections ultimately requires diagnosis of all involved pathogens [12] . Interestingly, recent studies have provided statistical evidence that co-infection is not random, and that co-infection occurs more frequently with certain pathogens than with others. "

The secreted IFNβ acts on neighboring cells and activates the STAT pathway via type I IFN receptor to induce IRF7 expression, which may result in amplification of type I IFN induction via such a positive feedback mechanism [54] . Among the members of IRFs, IRF3 is critically involved in the initial induction of IFNβ when cells are infected by viruses [54] . Although we found that in A549 cells, HPeV1 induced a sustained level of total IRF3 at both 37°C and 39°C, phosphorylated IRF3, the activated form of IRF3, only emerged and lasted until late infection at 37°C, not 39°C.

More autonomously, other viruses, including members of herpesviruses, alloherpesviruses and poxviruses, encode functional orthologues of IL-10, called viral IL-10s (vIL-10s) [87] . Due to the pleiotropic function of IL-10-mediated signaling in immunosuppression and cell differentiation (both T regulatory cells and M2c cells), viruses evolving these mechanisms are likely capable of masking host antiviral responses and causing persistent and systemic infections [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] . Porcine macrophages infected by classical swine fever virus (CSFV) showed an increase in the M2-marker arginase-1 (ARG-1) but a decrease in nitric oxide production, indicating a M2-prone polarization [55] .

In mice infected by T . regenti the response against cercarial antigens increased rapidly after the first infection and stayed at a relatively high level till day 120 post-infection [11] .

Accordingly, the presence of both α2,6and α2,3-linked sialic acids would mean that swine may potentially be infected by both avian and human viruses [23] .

In poultry LPAI viruses typically cause limited clinical signs [41] . However, unlike in water birds, LPAI viruses predominately infect respiratory epithelial cells [42] . Accordingly, it is thought that LPAI virus strains can also be transmitted amongst terrestrial poultry, roaming in dry pens at high densities, via respiratory droplets and aerosols [43] .

Additionally, preventing NOX-derived ROS through DPI appeared to successfully down modulate NLRP3 hyperactivation and IL-1β maturation in vitro (Fig 7F) . Furthermore, virus infected p47 phox-/macrophages manifested with significant reduction in ROS secretion, leading to the control of NLRP3 hyperactivation, which results in attenuation in severity of the viral FH (Fig 8) . These results are inconsistent with previous reports that have shown that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are not involved in activating NLRP3 inflammasome [41, 42] .

With the PCoA plot based on weighted UniFrac distance metric where the relative abundance of OTUs were considered, there was more significant clustering pattern observed between the 8-day-old non-infected chickens and the same-age infected counterparts at 7 DPI (p = 0.001, r = 0.841) (Figure 10D ).

"nih.gov"," At first, the virus infects and replicates in the mid-gut epithelium of the mosquito and then spreads to other organs until it reaches the salivary glands after 10-14 days where it can be inoculated to another person during subsequent blood meal. "
"nih.gov"," Since December 2013, Ebola has infected almost 28,000 people, mostly in West Africa, resulting in more than 11,400 deaths and attracting public interest worldwide [1] . This led to millions of Ebola-related Internet searches being performed during the period of the epidemic, making Ebola the most searched item on Yahoo engine and the fifth most searched term on Google in 2014 [2, 3] . Indeed, Internet represents a quickly growing source of health data with millions of people seeking healthcare information on the web daily [4] . "
"nih.gov"," HPAIV viruses are generally thought to arise in poultry after domestic birds become infected by LPAI H5 and H7 viruses from the wild-bird reservoir 31 . The probable long co-existence of multiple viruses in multiple hosts provides the driving force for the virus to adapt to infect humans. "
"nih.gov"," However, RSV infects the ciliated cells in primary well differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures via the apical surface, but HS is not detectable on this surface. "
"nih.gov"," We previously found that RSV infects HAE cultures via the apical surface and nearly exclusively infects ciliated cells [19] . However, HAE cultures do not express detectable HS on their apical surface [13] , leading us to hypothesize that a different viral receptor is responsible for RSV attachment to these cells and likely to human airways. "
"nih.gov"," To test this possibility, we inoculated HeLa and HAE cultures with rgRSV or the RSV mutant described above with a mutation in the last cysteine of the CX3C motif (C186S RSV). rgRSV and C186S RSV were comparably infectious for HeLa cells (Fig 3D) . In contrast, while rgRSV readily infected HAE cultures, C186S RSV was poorly infectious for these cells, similar to RSV completely lacking the G protein [24] . This finding indicates that C186 in the G protein is critical for RSV infection of HAE cultures and may be involved in RSV attachment to these cells. "
"nih.gov"," To examine this possibility, we inoculated mice with rgRSV lacking the G and SH genes, such that the F protein is the only glycoprotein expressed, and found that this virus infected both WT and CX3CR1-/-mice comparably, albeit poorly ( Fig 5B) . This finding suggests that G protein interaction with CX3CR1 is important for efficient infection of mice, but that the F protein may also have some attachment activity. "
"nih.gov"," RSV efficiently infects many immortalized cell lines, but it is not clear how closely this infectious process represents RSV infection of the human airway. "
"nih.gov"," For example, we have previously reported the discovery of an alphacoronavirus in M. tuberculata guano from a remote offshore island of New Zealand (Hall et al., 2014a) . Alphacoronaviruses exclusively infect mammals, so this virus either has been circulating in native bats for more than 1 million years or has arrived via other mammals that were introduced later by humans. "
