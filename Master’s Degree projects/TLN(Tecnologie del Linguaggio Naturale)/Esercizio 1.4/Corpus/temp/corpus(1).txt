doi.org | <s> The generation interval, defined as the interval between the time when an individual becomes infected and the time when that individual infects another individual (Svensson, 2007) , plays a key role in shaping the relationship between r and R 0 (Wearing et al., 2005; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007; Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Park et al., 2019) ; therefore, estimates of R 0 from different models directly depend on their implicit assumptions about the generation-interval distribution and the exponential growth rate. </s>

nih.gov | <s> Complement activation can affect influenza virus-specific immune response in the lung [19, 20] . After being infected by influenza virus , C3-deficient mice see significant decrease of T-cell reaction, and complement activation plays an important role in T-cell activation or recruitment [21, 22] . Martin has found that C3a and C5a can induce neutrophil migration in the lung infected by influenza virus [23] . All the above studies show that complement activation following influenza virus infection can significantly influence pulmonary infiltration and lung injury degree. </s>

nih.gov | <s> When a cell is infected by a virus , IκB is phosphorylated and hydrolyzed by UPP, thus releasing NF-κB, which enters the nucleus and activates transcription of genes encoding inflammatory responses [31] . Thus, the UPP may play a vital role in infection, and the host response to infection, by a variety of viral pathogens. </s> 
nih.gov | <s> However, the virus can still enter the cells even with inhibition of clathrin-or caveolae-mediated endocytosis, suggesting that influenza viruses infect cells through an additional clathrin-and caveolae-independent endocytic pathway [18] . We have recently reported that PI3K bound to Ras is preferentially translocated to the endosome and activated in this subcellular compartment; however, a role for this binding in the endosome has yet to be determined [19] . In this study, we demonstrate that Ras-PI3K signaling plays an indispensable role in the regulation of clathrinindependent endocytosis and influenza virus entry. </s> 
nih.gov | <s> Type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) are since long recognized as important players of the innate immune system, secreting antimicrobial proteins like surfactant protein A, C and D, but also producing a variety of cytokines and chemokines [1] [2] [3] . Due to their location, they are exposed to microbes reaching the alveolus and can be infected by several infectious agents , such as influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, Legionella pneumophila, Bacillus anthracis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is well known to multiply and to survive within AECII [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Indeed alveolar epithelial cells are being by far more numerous than the macrophages, the phagocytic cell prototype [11] . However besides the AECII, the alveolar surface is also covered by type I AEC but these cells mostly play a role 
nih.gov | <s> It is not clear how HCMV infects the fetus during pregnancy, but some studies demonstrate that placental infection with HCMV occurs before the transmission of the virus to the fetus and suggest that the placenta plays a role in vertical transmission of HCMV from mother to fetus. </s> 
nih.gov | <s> The rationale for this simplification is the fact that, during an infection, the two parameters play equivalent roles: doubling the rate at which virus is produced by cells will have the same effect on new infections as doubling the rate at which virus infects cells. </s> 
nih.gov | <s> Macrophages have been identified as one of the target cell population in the murine spleen [26] . Besides, macrophages play a major role in the early innate defense against Listeria monocytogenes via secretion of different cytokines [20, 56] . However, DCs were also observed to be directly infected by L . monocytogenes [57] . Since IFN induction requires intracellular Listeria, we would have expected that DCs, in addition to monocytes/macrophages, would be involved in IFN-b production. </s> 
nih.gov | <s> While it is unknown how common RDR is amongst ssDNA viruses, recombination patterns detectable within viruses isolated from nature display remarkable similarities across many of the rolling circle replicons [40, 89] which suggest that groups such as the nanoviruses, circoviruses and even the prokaryote infecting microviruses might also replicate by RDR mechanisms. </s> 
nih.gov | <s> NS1 and NS3 play an important role in orbivirus exit mechanisms from infected cells [15] . BTV infects mammalian cells, usually resulting in a lytic infection, while infection of KC cells derived from the BTV vector Culicoides sonorensis, become persistently infected with little or no evidence of cell lysis [56, 57] . Previous work showed that intracellular expression of an NS1 specific antibody fragment (scFv) destabilised the formation of NS1 tubules in BTV infected cells [14] . As a consequence, cells became persistently infected and viruses exited by budding instead of via cell lysis. </s> 
nih.gov | <s> Type II pneumocytes are responsible for the production and secretion of surfactant to lower the surface tension of water and allow membrane separation, and insufficient pulmonary surfactant in the alveoli may result in alveolar collapse [28, 29] . The 1918 pandemic H1N1 and high pathogenic H5N1 viruses preferentially infect type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophage in mice [15, 30] . Alveolar macrophages may play a critical role in disease pathogenesis, not through production of infectious virus but rather through the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines that may further damage alveolar pneumocytes [31] . These phenomena suggest that viral cell tropism may determine the processes of ARDS. </s> 
nih.gov | <s> TLR3 plays a key role in anti-viral immune responses and recognizes synthetic dsRNA like poly I:C and virus derived dsRNA contained in cells infected by positive-stranded RNA viruses and DNA viruses [74, 75] . It was shown recently that poly I:C enhances the susceptibility to secondary pulmonary infections by gram-positive bacteria in a mouse model [76] . The positive-stranded RNA virus rhinovirus enhances CEACAM5 expression in human nasal epithelial cells and two negative-stranded RNA viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3), enhance CEACAM1 expression in A549 and NHBE cells [67, 77] . Since the latter viruses have to be recognized via TLR7 or TLR8

Moreover, it is know that autophagy plays a major role in determining the fate of virally infected cells by blocking or promoting apoptotic mechanisms [23] . We have previously reported that apoptotic liver damage develops in rabbits infected by the RHDV and the effect is attenuated by treatment with antioxidants [5, 6] . In this study we analyzed changes with time in the activation of caspase-3, the common event initiated by multiple different stimuli that induces apoptosis [37] . Samples were incubated with a specific fluorigenic substrate whose cleavage indicated that infection resulted in a marked increase of caspase-3 activity only at 30 and 36 hpi ( Figure 5A ). </s>
